[{"categories":null,"content":"Badge Overview Girls will learn what inventors and engineers do while creating a model of a roller coaster!\nSteps to complete this badge:\n Make a simple Roller Coaster Car Build a model of a Roller Coaster Test your roller coaster  Activity 1 Make a simple roller coaster car Supplies Needed:\n Car kit included in Trefoil Trunk  Step 1. Make sure the wheels of the car are on the axel\nStep 2. Use the parts to build the rest of the car. You can choose to use all of the parts or not.\nStep 3. Decorate!\nAn axle is what attaches the wheels to the roller coaster car. It can be fixed (not moving) or rotating (spinning with the wheels.) In this car model, the axle is fixed and the wheels are rotating.\nActivity 2 Build a model of a roller coaster Items Needed:\n Large flat items, like cardboard, posters, or folders Stackable items, like boxes or books (Cookie boxes work great!) Tube like items for your coaster to go through like paper towel rolls, paper plates Room to work  Using things you find around your home, build a roller coaster ramp to test your roller coaster car. Start with a simple ramp. Once you've got a ramp that works well, try adding some hills or turns.\nActivity 3 Test your roller coaster Supplies Needed:\n Marble from Trefoil Trunk and track  Now that you have made your track it is time to test it out. Send the marble down the ramp and watch what happens. During the live session on May 25,2021, we will show our rollercoasters and work to make improvements. As you test the coaster think about:\n What works and what does not work so well? What happens when you change the height of your ramp? Does it make the marble change speed? Does the marble move easily? Are there any spots where the marble gets stuck?  Roller coaster engineers use this process of building and testing out a model to decide the best way to build a roller coaster before building it full sized. They look at how each part works and how all the parts work together. What could be improved about your car or roller coaster track?\n Post a picture of your coaster on BAND under the 'Roller Coaster Design' album  Go to Trailblazer TV to see several roller coasters in action and learn some fun science facts about roller coasters.\nBadge wrap up Save for the Badge Zoom Meeting On the Zoom meeting on May 25, we will complete our badge.\nPlease have ready:\n Your roller coaster Thoughts on ways to improve your roller coaster.  Now that you have completed this badge you should be able to\n Think like an engineer! Provide constructive feedback Improve on your ideas.  This badge will be mailed to you in May and you will be recognized at the court of awards.\n","description":"","tags":null,"title":"Rollercoaster","uri":"/posts/rollercoaster/"}]
